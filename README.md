# Santoku Learn

A Lua/C library for classification, regression, and retrieval built on
spectral embedding and ridge regression for extreme multi-label
classification (XMLC).

## Components

**Spectral Embedding** — Kernel spectral embedding via RP-Cholesky
factorization. Supports cosine, arccos, and Hellinger kernels over
sparse, dense, or binary input. Float32 inference pipeline.
([doc/spectral.md](doc/spectral.md))

**Ridge Regression** — Centered ridge with intercept, propensity
weighting for tail labels, and precomputed gram matrix for fast
hyperparameter search. Dense regression and sparse label prediction
modes. ([doc/optimize.md](doc/optimize.md))

**Hyperparameter Search** — GP-BO search with LHS initialization,
cost-cooled Expected Improvement, and Latin Hypercube candidate
generation. ([doc/optimize.md](doc/optimize.md))

**Binary Quantization and ANN** — Multi-index hashing for
Hamming-distance nearest neighbor retrieval with optional float
reranking. ([doc/ann.md](doc/ann.md))

**Evaluation** — Classification, regression, ranking (NDCG, Spearman,
Pearson), and retrieval (P/R/F1 with optimal-k) metrics. Graph-
constrained agglomerative clustering.
([doc/evaluation.md](doc/evaluation.md))

**GFM** — General F-Measure optimization for per-label threshold
selection.

## Usage Patterns

The library supports pipeline patterns from dense regression to full
XMLC with spectral embedding, ANN shortlisting, ridge classification,
and GFM thresholding.
