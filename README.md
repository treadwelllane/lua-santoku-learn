# Santoku Learn

A Lua/C library for classification, regression, and retrieval built on
Tsetlin Machines with a spectral embedding pipeline for extreme
multi-label classification (XMLC).

## Components

**Tsetlin Machine** — Regression TM with bit-planar state
representation, soft clause evaluation, per-chunk squared-error
feedback, and sparse mode with per-class token mapping and
absorption-driven feature streaming. A separate SSL (Stochastic
Searching on the Line) path handles continuous-feature regression.
([doc/regressor.md](doc/regressor.md))

**Hyperparameter Search** — Round-based adaptive search with the 1/5th
success rule for jitter adaptation, deduplication, size preference at
equal accuracy, and batched early stopping for final training.
([doc/optimize.md](doc/optimize.md))

**Spectral Embedding** — Nystrom approximation via RPCholesky landmark
selection on a rank-weighted cosine similarity kernel defined over
sparse binary features. Supports asymmetric mode for cross-population
embedding (e.g., documents into label eigenspace).
([doc/pca.md](doc/pca.md))

**Binary Quantization and ANN** — SFBS (Sequential Forward Bit
Selection) quantizes continuous or binary embeddings into compact codes
optimizing NDCG against a ground-truth neighbor structure. Multi-index
hashing provides Hamming-distance nearest neighbor retrieval with
early termination. ([doc/ann.md](doc/ann.md))

**Evaluation and Bit Selection** — Classification, regression, ranking
(NDCG, Spearman, Pearson), and retrieval (P/R/F1 with optimal-k)
metrics. Greedy SFBS bit/dimension selection. Graph-constrained
agglomerative clustering with complete-linkage distance and
majority-vote centroids. ([doc/evaluation.md](doc/evaluation.md))

## Usage Patterns

The library supports five pipeline patterns from simple dense
classification to full XMLC with bipartite spectral embedding, two-round
SFBS quantization, and Hamming ANN retrieval.
